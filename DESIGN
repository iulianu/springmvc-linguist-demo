Design notes
===
This is a Spring MVC app. If you are not familiar with it, start here:

JSON conversion done implicitly through MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter.

Because the Servlet API is not streaming, the request has to be read entirely
in memory. This limits our ability to handle large request bodies in a memory-efficient
manner.
The service layer _does_ have a streaming approach.

Everything is in one JAR, but in real life the business logic and
the web service would be in different JARs, built separately.

We use raw types (String, int) but for better design we should have
value types, e.g. for token counts which must be unsigned ints.
