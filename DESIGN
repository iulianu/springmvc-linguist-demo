Design notes
===
This is a Spring MVC app. If you are not familiar with it, start here:

JSON conversion done implicitly through MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter.

Because I did not want to deal with the raw InputStream exposed by the Servlet API,
I am reading the entire request in memory. This will not work with request bodies
large enough to overflow the Java heap.

The service layer _is_ designed to work with streams though.

Everything is in one JAR, but in real life the business logic and
the web service would be in different JARs, built separately.

We use raw types (String, int) but for better design we should have
value types, e.g. for token counts which must be unsigned ints.
