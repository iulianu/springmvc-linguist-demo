Getting started
===

To run the service:
  mvn tomcat7:run

The service starts on port 9090.

When sending JSON requests, make sure to set the Content-Type header
to "application/json".

To run tests:
  mvn test

This code was developed and tested with JRE 1.8.0_112 and Maven 3.3.9
on macOS 10.12.2.

Functional notes
===

No concern at all was given to escaping characters. For example, the
'&' character is used as a delimiter but could conceivably appear in
a phrase as well.

Also no concern at all was given to encoding. Requests and responses
are assumed to be UTF-8 strings.

For the /format endpoint, no validation is performed on token counts,
in other words the service does not do tokenization, it transparently
passes token counts back.

For the /ngram endpoint, a _token_ is composed of alphanumeric characters
only, i.e. letters and digits. All other characters, punctuation,
question marks, etc, are ignored.
