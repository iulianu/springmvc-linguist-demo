Functional notes
===
No concern at all was given to escaping characters. The & character is used as a
delimiter but could conceivably appear in a phrase as well.

Also no concern at all was given to encoding. Requests and responses are assumed
to be UTF-8 strings.

No validation is performed on token counts, in other words the service does not
do tokenization, it transparently passes token counts back.
